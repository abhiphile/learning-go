# Roadmap for learning Go
Here's a 20-day roadmap to learn Go (Golang) completely:

### **Week 1: Go Fundamentals**
#### **Day 1: Setup & Basics**
- Install Go and set up the environment.
- Learn about `go run`, `go build`, `go fmt`, `go mod init`.
- Write and run a simple "Hello, World!" program.
- Understand Go’s syntax, variables, and data types.

#### **Day 2: Control Flow & Functions**
- Learn `if`, `for`, `switch`, and `defer`.
- Define and call functions.
- Learn about variadic functions and multiple return values.

#### **Day 3: Pointers & Structs**
- Learn about pointers and their usage in Go.
- Understand structs and how to define custom types.

#### **Day 4: Arrays, Slices, and Maps**
- Learn about arrays and slices.
- Understand slices' internal working and make use of `append()`.
- Learn how to use maps (hashmaps/dictionaries in other languages).

#### **Day 5: Methods & Interfaces**
- Learn about methods and how they differ from functions.
- Understand interfaces and how they enable polymorphism in Go.

#### **Day 6: Concurrency Basics**
- Learn about goroutines.
- Understand how to use channels for communication.

#### **Day 7: Error Handling & Testing**
- Learn Go’s approach to error handling with `error` interface.
- Understand `panic`, `recover`, and `defer`.
- Write unit tests using the `testing` package.

### **Week 2: Intermediate Go**
#### **Day 8: File Handling & JSON Parsing**
- Read/write files using `os` and `io` packages.
- Work with JSON data using `encoding/json`.

#### **Day 9: HTTP & Web Applications**
- Learn `net/http` for building HTTP servers.
- Build a basic REST API.

#### **Day 10: Context & Middleware**
- Understand `context` for managing request lifecycles.
- Learn to implement middleware in web apps.

#### **Day 11: Databases & ORM**
- Learn how to interact with PostgreSQL using `database/sql`.
- Use an ORM like GORM for easier database management.

#### **Day 12: Dependency Management & Modules**
- Learn how Go modules work (`go mod`).
- Understand dependency management in Go.

#### **Day 13: Advanced Concurrency**
- Learn about worker pools.
- Use `sync.WaitGroup`, `sync.Mutex`, and `sync.Cond`.

#### **Day 14: Build a Mini-Project**
- Create a CLI tool or a small web service.
- Implement everything you've learned.

### **Week 3: Advanced Go & Real-world Development**
#### **Day 15: Networking & WebSockets**
- Learn about `net` package for TCP/UDP communication.
- Implement WebSockets in Go.

#### **Day 16: Performance Optimization & Benchmarking**
- Profile and benchmark Go programs using `pprof` and `testing.Benchmark`.

#### **Day 17: Build & Deploy a Full-fledged API**
- Create a production-grade API using `chi` or `gin`.
- Add authentication (JWT or session-based).

#### **Day 18: Microservices & gRPC**
- Learn about gRPC and Protocol Buffers.
- Implement a gRPC service.

#### **Day 19: Docker & Kubernetes**
- Containerize a Go application using Docker.
- Deploy it using Kubernetes.

#### **Day 20: Final Project & Review**
- Build a fully functional project (e.g., a task manager, chat app, or analytics dashboard).
- Review key concepts, best practices, and Go’s ecosystem.
